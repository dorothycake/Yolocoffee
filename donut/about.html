    <div class="star">
      <p>Our coffee comes directly from the earth so we naturally take an interest in treating it well. We strive to reduce the impact our stores have on the environment and this commitment influences almost every aspect of how we approach design and construction, including landscape, building methods, materials, lighting and more.</p><p>We believe a coffeehouse should be a welcoming, inviting and familiar place for people to connect, so we design our stores to reflect the unique character of the neighborhoods they serve. We are also interested in the way design can connect us all to sustainable building practices and provoke thoughtful questions and engagement with the built environment. In addition to reducing energy and water consumption, we incorporate reused and recycled materials wherever possible and often use locally inspired design details and materials in our stores.</p>
